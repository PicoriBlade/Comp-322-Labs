matrix_gen : noticed the rand was spitting the same numbers so i 
asked for help and now its seeded with srand and time(null)

also noticed "rand()%200 -100" was giving numbers from -100 to 99
and thats not -100 to 100 so i tried rand%201-100 and that works

I got the code working i think. hard to check it since when i open a 10240x10240 size
file vim will just freeze so idk whats going on. pretty sure it works if not. gg
